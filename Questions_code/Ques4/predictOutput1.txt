Predict the output:
void main()
{
 int a=4;
 int b=5;
 a++;b--;
 cout<<++a<<” “<<b–-;
}

Ans: The value of a is 4, a++ means a=5.
     The value of b is 5, b-- means b=4
     ++a means a=6,
     b-- means b=4, and after printing 4 value will be decremented by 1 as it is post increment.
     Output should be: 6 4
